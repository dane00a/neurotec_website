					<p class="desc" style="font-weight:strong;">Amongst other things, here are some of the things that Neurotec Offers:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Hundreds of Vehicles of all time periods and shapes, ranging from the tiny cavaliers of WWI to modern tanks that wouldn't hesitate to break your wall down and blow up your house.</li>
							<li>Crews: You have a tank crew, and if they're killed, your tank won't function correctly!</li>
							<li>Realism: Most vehicles have fuel and ammunitions supplies that must be maintained, lest you become boned on the battlefield!</li>
							<li>Custom Maps: Neurotec comes with a bunch of custom maps to suit all your combat needs!</li>
							<li>Sophisticated AI: In a Multiplayer Server, or a single-player LAN game, type "bot" into the console and spawn a tank; you'll instantly have an opponent to fight against. And if that's not enough, the bots are intellegent enough to speak to you via text chat!</li>
							<li>New Weapons: Take on the Stinger, Jericho Launcher, RPG-7, and more to kill your way to victory!</li>
							<li>Pretty Explosions: Get ready for cinematic shots; the particle effects have been reworked and are fantastic!</li>
							<li>Nukes: You literally can't go wrong with this; I don't even need to explain this.</li>
							<li>No Requirements: Just download the mod and fire it up; you don't need any external source games like Counter-Strike: Source.</li>
							<li>Free: Free as in no money, but also Free as in Freedom; all of our code and resources can be used in your project (with proper attribution).</li>
