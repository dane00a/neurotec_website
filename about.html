						<div class="ab_question">
							<p class="question">Does this website involve Neurological Technology (like what doctors use?)</p>
							<p class="desc">No; shit, even on the test server, some people found this site through Google and somehow began emailing me (dane00a). As a heads up: THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH BUYING EQUIPMENT! STOP FREAKING EMAILING ME!</p>
							<p class="desc">Now, with that out of the way...</p>
							<p class="question">So, who are you people?</p>
							<p class="desc">Right now, we're a bunch of programmers, modellers, rippers, and other junk from all across the planet. We'll be famous one day, but for now, we code our asses off for this Gmod addon (which is pretty expansive at this point).</p>
							<p class="desc">Our team consists of Hoffa, StarChick, Killst3aks, aftokinito, and various community contributions. dane00a currently maintains and updates the website.</p>
							<p class="question">What exactly IS Neurotec?</p>
							<p class="desc">Ok, look, if you didn't catch it on any of the other pages, this is a modification/addon compilation for Garry's Mod, a sandbox physics game. It doesn't require any external dependencies such as Counter Strike: Source and etc.</p>
							<p class="question">Where do I download it?</p>
							<p class="desc"><a href="download.html">Right Here (Click Me!)</a></p>
							<p class="question">Why Isn't This on the Workshop?</p>
							<p class="desc">Simple: This addon is ginormous; it's over 10 gigabytes. Since the Workshop only allows uploads of 100mB per addon, we'd need about 100 parts, give or take, and it's too difficult to maintain those parts.</p>
							<p class="question">"It's not working" OR "My shit is broken!"</p>
							<p class="desc">First, check the download page and make sure you followed the instructions correctly. Secondly, purge your addons of all the crap you don't need. If that doesn't help, <a href="http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1160981">Click Here to be directed to out Facepunch Forum thread for assistance.</a></p>
							<p class="question">"I found a bug" OR "I want a Feature!"</p>
							<p class="desc"><a href='http://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1160981'>Click Here to be taken to the Facepunch Forum thread</a>, and you can submit your inquiries there.</p>
							<p class="question">I like what you do. Where can I donate?</p>
							<p class="desc"><a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=robin.hofstrom%40gmail.com&lc=US&item_name=NeuroTec%20Open%20Source%20Development%A4cy_code=EUR&bn=PP-DonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG.gif%3aNonHosted">Click Here to redirected to the donation page.</a></p>
							<p class="question">Can we use your code/models/resources?</p>
							<p class="desc">This would not have been possible without the effort from StarChick971 and Sillirion with contributions from Fireking552, Flyboi, Inaki and Sakarias88 and many many more. We believe that sharing is caring and seing how we have used tons of other peoples models creating this we give you the full right to use any parts of our source code for your own projects.</p>
							<p class="question">I have another question not on here!</p>
